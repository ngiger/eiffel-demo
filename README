Here you find a small Eiffel project which I used to get
started exporing some Eiffel features.

My interests are:
- Design by Contract
- Test Driver Development
- Embedded (Linux/vxWorks)
- Continuos Integration (Hudson)

Some interesting links:
Cross-Compilation: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/eiffel_software/message/18142

I installed EiffelStudio 6.7.8.5123-1.

The demos/learning at dev.eiffel.com are really terrific and kept
me busy for a few evenings.

Using EiffelStudio I was able to run the AutoTest like this:
a) Create a manual tests
b) Compile the main application
c) Open LED_DRIVER_TEST_SET in the editor
d) Compile it
e) In the AutoTest-Window select the LED_DRIVER_TEST_SET class.
f) Click "Run Selected Tests"-button 

For continuos integration I always check, how easy it is to
to a completly batch driven checkout/compile/test cycle on
a server which has graphical output device.

The ruby scripts run_test.rb in this directory should allow
you to run the tests automatically. (We assume that the
nessary environment variable ISE_EIFFEL, ISE_PLATFORM and PATH
are set correctly).

The file config.xml is used on my hudson server 
http://ngiger.dyndns.org/hudson/job/eiffel-demo/
to run the tests after each check-in.
