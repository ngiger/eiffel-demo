Here you find a small Eiffel project which I used to get
started exporing some Eiffel features.

My interests are:
- Design by Contract
- Test Driver Development
- Embedded (Linux/vxWorks)

I installed EiffelStudio 6.7.8.5123-1.

The demos/learning at dev.eiffel.com are really terrific and kept
me busy for a few evenings.
